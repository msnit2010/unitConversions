Please perform a thorough review of the entire website and rewrite or refactor where necessary to align with Apple’s App Store Development Guidelines (https://developer.apple.com/app-store/guidelines/). Specifically, ensure the following:

### 1. **User Experience (UX) and Design**
- Follow Apple’s **Human Interface Guidelines**:
  - Use a clean and minimalistic design with a focus on clarity and user interaction.
  - Ensure consistent layout, spacing, and alignment across all pages.
  - Optimize for touch-friendly interfaces (e.g., large, tappable buttons with a minimum size of 44x44px).
  - Provide smooth, intuitive navigation with clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., hover, press, and selected states).
  - Support dynamic type for readability, scaling fonts appropriately for accessibility needs.

### 2. **Content Quality**
- Review all content for clarity, conciseness, and professionalism:
  - Rewrite unclear or overly technical language to make it user-friendly.
  - Remove any redundant or outdated content.
  - Ensure the text aligns with the tone and style of Apple’s best practices (e.g., simple, direct, and approachable).

### 3. **Performance**
- Optimize all assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) for fast load times and smooth performance.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources (e.g., images or third-party scripts).
- Test the website on low-bandwidth networks to ensure acceptable performance.

### 4. **Accessibility (A11y)**
- Ensure compliance with Apple’s accessibility requirements:
  - Support screen readers by using appropriate `aria-labels` and semantic HTML elements.
  - Validate color contrast ratios for both dark mode and day mode to meet WCAG 2.1 standards.
  - Provide keyboard navigation support across all features.
  - Add dynamic font scaling to improve readability for users with visual impairments.

### 5. **Privacy and Security**
- Clearly explain data collection and usage in the Privacy Policy.
- Ensure no unnecessary data is collected or shared.
- Secure all user interactions and form submissions, encrypting data where applicable.
- Verify compliance with Apple’s guidelines on privacy, including not using unnecessary tracking mechanisms.

### 6. **Functionality and Testing**
- Fix all bugs and broken features, including:
  - Ensure the Common Conversions dynamically populate correctly.
  - Verify navigation links redirect users to the intended pages without errors.
  - Fix the "Submit Feedback" button to work as expected.
- Test all features across multiple browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
- Validate consistent behavior on iOS devices (Safari browser) for proper Apple ecosystem support.

### 7. **Localization**
- Ensure translations are implemented for all supported languages, matching the quality of the English version.
- Add language-specific enhancements where possible, such as adjusting layouts for text expansion in languages like German or Spanish.

### 8. **Reusability and Scalability**
- Refactor the codebase to be modular, clean, and reusable:
  - Ensure components are well-structured for scalability.
  - Remove unnecessary dependencies or libraries.
- Apply DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles and maintain separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 9. **Dark Mode and Light Mode**
- Review and refine both light mode and dark mode designs:
  - Ensure proper contrast and readability in both modes.
  - Fix color issues for elements like Conversion Result and Formula boxes in dark mode.
  - Verify the text visibility and contrast in day mode, updating colors where needed.

### 10. **Overall Alignment**
- Align the website’s features, layout, and behavior with Apple’s core principles:
  - Delight users with small details and animations that enhance the experience.
  - Keep the interface intuitive and free from clutter.
  - Ensure the overall site feels polished, consistent, and professional.

### Final Deliverables
- Provide a detailed summary of all changes made.
- Highlight areas that required significant rewrites or redesigns.
- Test the updated website against Apple’s performance and usability standards.
- Verify the website aligns with Apple’s App Store Development Guidelines and is ready for high-quality user experiences.
